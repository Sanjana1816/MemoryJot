MemoryJot â€“ Smart Reflective Journal
<br>
MemoryJot is made to build an intelligent journal that captures, stores, and retrieves personal reflections using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users can interact with the system to recall thoughts, summarize past experiences, and reflect meaningfully based on previously logged entries.
